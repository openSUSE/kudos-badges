## 🧩 Who is it for?
Who should earn this badge?  
(e.g. packagers, translators, mentors…)

---

## 🧠 Example of qualifying work
What kind of work or contribution should count?  
(e.g. “Merged 10 PRs”, “Helped 3 new contributors”)

> Badges should reflect **consistent effort** and be **relatively exclusive**, not something everyone gets automatically.

---

## 🤖 Automation
Can it be awarded automatically via [Kudos bots](https://github.com/openSUSE/kudos/tree/main/bots)?  
If yes, explain what measurable public data could be used (e.g. merged PRs, package uploads).

---

## 🎨 Graphics idea
Describe what the badge could look like — icon, color scheme, or symbolism.

---

## 🏆 Purpose
What does this badge recognize and why does it matter?

---

✅ Keep criteria clear and measurable.  
Add the description and criteria to your PR when submitting.
